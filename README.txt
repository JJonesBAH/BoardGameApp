Application I am building to help manage a board game club I take part in. 

This application is a very rough draft, I have yet to do much of the logic for the application. 

This application currently really only gets input from a CSV file to create users for the application and then outputs the created users to a new CSV file for storage. 

In addition you can choose to update the previously created CSV file to append new users to the end of the file while still updating the number of users contained in the file which is the first line of the CSV file. This is a little bit of a hack for the moment. 

In the future I plan on expanding this application to much more. Currently I have just done the basics for learing purpouses.
